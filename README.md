# Public-Transport-System-Optimization-
The current bus transportation system relies on experience-based manual decisions for covering stops and timings and it results in suboptimal results, longer ride times, longer distances travelled which increases cost as well as carbon emission, and use of more resources than required. Timetables are often outdated and created based on static information of traffic resulting in suboptimal results and also waiting time of passengers increases due to unreliable routing of buses hence we want to implement a solution for a transportation system that gives the most optimal result, is automatic and less prone to errors!
